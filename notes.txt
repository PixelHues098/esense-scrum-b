STUFF TODO BEFORE STUFF GETS FLOODED

what is the difference between kanban and scrum

scrum has sprints, kanban doesnt

sprint has backlogs

if we consider kanban as just a ongoing backlog, then they're the same

if they're the same, what does a project consist of?
	sprints, backlog is essentialy sprint 0 or -1

Project should contain the type of project instead of having separate tables for each

Sprint and Swimlane will contain id of project

Issues will contain ids of project, sprint, swimlane

Default value for sprint is project id + 0 (id for sprint representing backlog)

Default value for swimlane is project id + 0 (id for to do)

Structure of sprint
 - Name
 - Start/End date
 - Issues
 - Reports
 - 

What to do with project?
 + Add listed users to added members
 + Create function for getting project
 + Create base swimlane (todo(0), in progress(1), done(2))
 + Create base sprint 0 (will act as backlog for scrum and always active for kanban)
